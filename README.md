# Purpose

To help develop my skills in web development and learn the process for:

- Folder/File Structure
- Project Setup
  - npm
  - configuring any dependencies (i.e Tailwind and/or Webpack)
- UI/UX Design
  - Figma
- Best practices for front-end web development.
- Github Issues and PRs
- Learning Github Actions and Workflows

While it is a small project, this will help me with getting accustomed to using tools
that web developers use to develop and maintain their projects. This will be especially useful
to get used to working with Github Actions to deploy websites on Github with custom projects.
