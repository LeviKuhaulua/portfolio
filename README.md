# Purpose

To help develop my skills in web development and learn the process for:

- Folder/File Structure
- Project Setup
  - npm
  - configuring any dependencies (i.e Tailwind and/or Webpack)
- UI/UX Design
  - Figma
- Best practices for front-end web development.
- Github Issues and PRs

While it is a small project, this will help me with getting accustomed to using tools
that web developers use to develop and maintain their projects (no backend just yet lol).
